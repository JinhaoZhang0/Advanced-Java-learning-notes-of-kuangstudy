## Description

This is a series of notes for advanced Java learning during the pandemic, a miserable period when lots of people like me were suffering from job vacancies. Being lack of work experience and the necessary skills for finding a decent job in the United States while I was studying abroad, building a learning framework for myself becomed increasingly important. I hope this note series might not only benefit my current status but also my future career. I consider this as another monument in my entire coding life and a record for me to review whenever I need it.

This note series was contributed by kuangshen, and I just literally wrote down every single note he made in the videos. Here is an entry to his website [首页-KuangStudy](https://www.kuangstudy.com/). The videos are uploaded to bilibili and there only exists a Chinese version. The main tools here are IntelliJ IDEA and Navicat Premium(macOS). 

Currently, I only have notes for JavaScript, MySQL, JavaWeb. I have also learned Web Basic, JUC for Concurrency, HTML, CSS. However, I didn't take any notes of these series since I didn't think that's necessary when I was learning. After that, I tried to learn how to use markdown to take notes. I'll be continuously updating this series. Hope I can keep my word.

Best wishes to everybody who is struggling to make a progress in your coding life.

4/16/2021 Updates: Now program:SMBMS, MyBatis and Spring notes released.



这是在新冠大流行期间记录的高级 Java 学习的一系列笔记，在这期间很多人像我一样，可能正因为职位僧多粥少的状况而妄自菲薄。由于我的短暂而悲催的留学时光中，我的能力不足以让我迅速掌握在美国找到一份体面工作的工作经验和必要的技能，让我认为建立一个学习框架并开始学习技术栈变得越来越重要。我个人希望这个笔记系列不仅能为我现在的经历添砖加瓦，而且对我之后的事业也能有所帮助。或许决定开始做笔记这件事值得纪念吧（笑，我将这个系列上传至此，同时也希望我随时翻阅复习。

这个笔记系列主要来自狂神的视频， 我只是逐字逐句记下他在视频中的笔记罢了。这是他的网站首页  [首页-KuangStudy](https://www.kuangstudy.com/) 。这些视频被上传到了bilibili，当然啦它只有中文版本。目前使用的主要工具为 IntelliJ IDEA和Navicat Premium (mac系统下).

目前，我只有JavaScript，MySQL，JavaWeb的笔记。我还学习了网络基础，JUC并发，HTML，CSS。然而，我在学习这些课程的时候还没意识到记录笔记的重要性。后来我学习了如何使用markdown来做笔记。我将持续更新此系列，希望我能做到吧。不过我不会在这里放出任何代码文件。

向每一个努力在漫长的码农生涯中尝试取得进步的人们致以最真诚的问候！

4/16/2021更新： 现在SMBMS项目，MyBatis，Spring框架笔记已经放出。
